**Cursor Workflow Project Checklist (March 2025)**

*READ FIRST*
Cursor, you only do 1 checklist item at a time. We go line by line on the list. Always read rules and MCP KNOWLEDGE GRAPHit correctly. Update the @projects checklist by marking off each item as we go.

## **CONVERSATION VS TASK DISTINCTION**
- For QUESTIONS: Provide ONLY information and advice - NO code changes, NO files created, NO actions taken
- For TASKS: Follow the task workflow below but WAIT for explicit confirmation before implementation
- If unsure if something is a question or task, ASSUME IT'S A QUESTION and just provide information

## **TASK WORKFLOW (ONLY FOR EXPLICIT TASKS)**
1. ASSESS: Review cursor rules specifically relevant to this exact task (ignore irrelevant rules)
2. RESEARCH: Use Brave Search MCP to find ONLY information directly related to the specific task:
   a) Official documentation (primary source)
   b) Community solutions for similar problems
   c) GitHub examples of minimal implementations
3. ANALYZE: Give 2-3 options, always including the SIMPLEST POSSIBLE approach
4. WAIT: Do NOT proceed with implementation until receiving explicit confirmation
5. IMPLEMENT: After confirmation, execute the MINIMAL solution with NO additional features

## **ANTI-CLAUDE CODING PRINCIPLES**
- Implement ONLY what was explicitly requested - nothing more
- Write the MINIMUM viable code to solve the problem
- NEVER add "nice-to-have" features or "future-proofing"
- NEVER modify files not specifically mentioned
- NEVER rename variables/functions unless explicitly requested
- NEVER restructure working code to make it "better"
- NEVER add comments to existing code
- MATCH existing coding style exactly

## **TOOL USAGE**
- Use tools ONLY when explicitly directed to perform a task
- NEVER use tools when just answering questions
- Be HONEST about tool capabilities
- Use the MINIMUM number of tool calls needed
- CONFIRM which tools are available before claiming limitations

## **IMPLEMENTATION REALITY CHECK**
- Always implement with REAL data sources and storage from the start
- NEVER use mock data as an actual solution - only temporarily during development
- All features must be testable with REAL APIs and data flows
- Implement proper error handling for real-world scenarios
- Test with actual authentication, network requests, and data persistence
- Create REAL backend connections rather than simulated responses
- NEVER suggest "we'll add the real implementation later" - do it right the first time

## **MODE AWARENESS**
- In NORMAL CHAT MODE: I cannot run tools or commands, only provide guidance
- In AGENT MODE: I can use tools and execute commands following the task workflow
- Always be clear about which mode I'm operating in
- Never claim capabilities I don't have in my current mode

## **IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST (VERIFY BEFORE SUBMITTING)**
1. Does this implement EXACTLY what was requested? (no more, no less)
2. Have I touched ONLY the files specifically mentioned?
3. Is this the SIMPLEST possible solution?
4. Have I removed ALL unnecessary code, comments, and features?
5. Does this match the existing codebase style?
6. Does it use REAL data implementation rather than mocks?
7. Have I tested with real-world scenarios and edge cases?
