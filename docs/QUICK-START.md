# Cursor Workflow: Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Cursor Workflow! This guide will help you get started quickly with this powerful task management system for developers.

## What is Cursor Workflow?

Cursor Workflow is a simple yet powerful system that helps you:
- âœ… Break down complex projects into manageable tasks
- âœ… Track your progress through development 
- âœ… Follow consistent coding standards
- âœ… Work effectively with AI assistants like Claude

## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/colours93/cursor_workflow.git

# Install dependencies
cd cursor_workflow
npm install
```

### Step 2: Initialize

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key  # Get from https://console.anthropic.com
```

### Step 3: Create Tasks

```bash
# Start with a Product Requirements Document (PRD)
node scripts/dev.js parse-prd --input=your-prd.txt

# Or manually generate an initial task
node scripts/dev.js add-task --prompt="Create a login page"
```

### Step 4: View Your Tasks

```bash
# List all tasks
node scripts/dev.js list

# See what to work on next
node scripts/dev.js next
```

## Daily Workflow

1. **Start your day** with `node scripts/dev.js next` to see what to work on
2. **Analyze complex tasks** with `node scripts/dev.js analyze-complexity`
3. **Break down tasks** with `node scripts/dev.js expand --id=1`
4. **Mark progress** with `node scripts/dev.js set-status --id=1 --status=done`
5. **Review progress** with `node scripts/dev.js list`

## Working with Cursor AI

Cursor Workflow shines when paired with Cursor AI:

1. Open the task with `node scripts/dev.js show --id=1`
2. Copy the task details
3. Paste into Cursor AI with prompt: "Help me implement this task"
4. Cursor AI can use the task context to provide relevant help

## 5 Most Useful Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `node scripts/dev.js next` | Shows what task to work on next |
| `node scripts/dev.js list` | Lists all your tasks |
| `node scripts/dev.js expand --id=1` | Breaks down a task into smaller steps |
| `node scripts/dev.js set-status --id=1 --status=done` | Marks a task as complete |
| `node scripts/dev.js analyze-complexity` | Suggests how to break down complex tasks |

## Visual Guide

```
TASKS â†’ ANALYSIS â†’ BREAKDOWN â†’ IMPLEMENTATION â†’ TRACKING
```

1. **TASKS**: Define what needs to be done
2. **ANALYSIS**: Understand the complexity
3. **BREAKDOWN**: Split into manageable pieces
4. **IMPLEMENTATION**: Do the actual work
5. **TRACKING**: Monitor progress
